:: woods
You run into the thicket of woods before you. Rain is comming down in droves and wind whips your hair into an unmanagable tangle.
 You keep running through the woods despite the rain. No one calls for you to stop and you feel adrenaline pump through your system.
 When dawn breaks, you find yourself on a beach with a quiet, abandoned cabin.
