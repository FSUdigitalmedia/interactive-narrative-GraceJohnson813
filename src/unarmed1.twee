You race through the hallway and round a corner, only to run right into the scientist. 
He glares angerily and grabs your arm in a brusing hold. "You ungrateful monster! I told you to stay in the lab!"
He begins to drag you back to the lab as he continues,"You would be better off terminated and that's exactly what I am going to do!"

That doesn't sound good! Quick, You have 6 seconds to get away!
