:: run1
There is only a small beat of hesitation before you suddenly spring up and begin to run. The scientist hadn't expected this and you successfully knock him over.
You exit the lab and enter a hallway where the lights feel a bit too bright. Even though you are blinded for a moment you keep running. There is no one else around, strangely.
You are taking the first right turn when you hear the lab door open behind you and the scientist begins to chase after you.
